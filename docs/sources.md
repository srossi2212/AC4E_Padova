# Sources And Live Links

Checked for the Padova orientation pass on 2026-06-24. Agent tools change
quickly; verify version-sensitive UI labels and settings in the installed tool.

## Provenance

- Initial import source: `meleantonio/AC4E_LSE_PhD_Students`
- Import manifest: [`docs/import_manifest.md`](import_manifest.md)
- Main reference workshop: `meleantonio/AC4E_Pavia`
- Pavia guide reference: `AC4E_Pavia/GUIDE.md`
- Pavia orchestration reference: `AC4E_Pavia/guide/03-agents-orchestration.md`

The words "LSE" and "Pavia" should normally appear only as provenance or source
references in participant-facing Padova orientation files.

Harness note checked on 2026-06-24: the Padova Codex lane uses
`.agents/skills/` for skills, `.codex/agents/` for subagents, `.codex/hooks.json`
plus `.codex/hooks/` for hooks, and `.codex/config.toml` for MCP configuration
examples. Older Pavia issue text used `/config/hooks/`, `/config/mcp/`, and
`/concepts/subagents/`; current official docs use `/hooks/`, `/mcp/`, and
`/subagents/`.

- Claude Code MCP: <https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp>

Harness note checked on 2026-06-24: the Padova Claude lane uses
`.claude/skills/` for project skills, `.claude/agents/` for project subagents,
`.claude/settings.json` for permissions and hooks, `.claude/hooks/` for hook
scripts, and root `.mcp.json` for project MCP servers. Settings examples use
`permissions.deny` and sandbox `filesystem.denyRead` / `denyWrite` for `.env`,
secret, raw-data, and private-data paths.

## Cursor

- Cursor hooks: <https://cursor.com/docs/hooks>
- Cursor MCP: <https://cursor.com/docs/mcp>
- Cursor cloud agents: <https://cursor.com/docs/cloud-agent>

Harness note checked on 2026-06-24: the Padova Cursor lane uses
`.cursor/rules/*.mdc` for project rules, `AGENTS.md` for simple shared
instructions, `.cursor/skills/` for project skills, `.cursor/agents/` for
project subagents, and `.cursor/mcp.json` for project MCP servers. The MCP
example uses Cursor interpolation (`${env:FRED_API_KEY}` and
`${workspaceFolder}`). Hook examples live in `.cursor/hooks.json` plus
`.cursor/hooks/`, but hook event support is version-sensitive and should be
verified in the installed Cursor release before use.

MCP/FRED note checked on 2026-06-24: `agent-harness/mcp/fred/` is a bundled
stdio MCP example with bounded public FRED search, series metadata, and
observation tools. It reads `FRED_API_KEY` only from the environment, supports
offline teaching samples when no key is set, and does not accept arbitrary URLs
or local file paths.

Playwright note checked on 2026-06-24: the Padova demo uses a local static form
instead of a live public website so workshop runs are deterministic and
read-only. The Python setup follows the current docs pattern of installing
Playwright and browser binaries before running automation. The TypeScript spec
uses user-facing locators and assertions, following current best-practice
guidance to test rendered behavior rather than implementation details.

## Cloud Orchestration Notes

Checked on 2026-06-24 against official docs:

- Codex cloud tasks run in a cloud environment and can be delegated from GitHub
  with `@codex`; `@codex review` asks for PR review rather than implementation.
- Codex project subagents live in `.codex/agents/*.toml`; read-only reviewer
  examples should use restricted sandbox settings.
- Claude Code project subagents live in `.claude/agents/` and are managed from
  `/agents`; project subagents can be checked into version control.
- Cursor supports subagents across editor, CLI, and cloud-agent contexts. The
  current docs describe `/in-cloud` for a cloud subagent on its own branch, and
  note that cloud subagents use team MCP configuration rather than local
  `.cursor/mcp.json`.

The shared Padova templates therefore use GitHub issues, branch names, allowed
files, forbidden files, acceptance criteria, evidence, reviewer prompts, and
stop conditions instead of relying on one tool-specific UI.
